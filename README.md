Sys32 is a tool that allows anyone to run windows.

Without sys32, you're very prone to having inferior technology and won't be able to code properly. Supposedly.
NOTE: sys32 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of `<coding_language/dependency/requirement_1>`
* You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine. State which OS is supported/which is not.
* You have read `<guide/link/documentation_related_to_project>`.

## Using sys32

To use sys32, follow these steps:
